# OCASA: Orange County Academy of Sciences and Arts

## What is OCASA?

OCASA (Orange County Academy of Sciences and Arts) is a tuition-free public charter school system in California, USA, focused on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) education.

## Why I Liked This Project

I have been part of the community during my college years and have worked with colleges and NGOs, teaching underprivileged children. This project resonates with my personal mission of **giving back to the community**, and it felt meaningful to contribute to education initiatives that create real impact.

This project is handled by the **DM team here in GKMIT**.
